bootstrap is hella neat! today i chose one of their website templates,
and created a biz website located in Toronto. was neat to realize how
easily customizable bootstrap templates are — also glad that i can now
see / understand what’s doing what enough to mess around with / not
break it.

i learned about API keys also, in order to switch out the embedded map.
was easier than i thought it would be. i felt like a damn wizard. so
cool to learn about different development tools.
